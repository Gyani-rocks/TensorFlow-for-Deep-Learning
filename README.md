# TensorFlow-for-Deep-Learning
TensorFlow is a Google-created software library that's used for deep learning and machine learning. It's a popular choice for deep learning because of its ability to combine various machine learning and deep learning models and algorithms into a single interface. TensorFlow also offers a high-level API, which means that complex coding isn't required to prepare a neural network.
